1) General

We'd like to thank everyone for their detailed reviews and constructive criticism

1.1) General Concerns

-We need more references to position our work better and highlight its novelty and the reviewers gave suggestions for references. We have gone through the works suggested (and more) and included them in a revised paper. However, we feel that this doesn't affect the novelty of our work: 

--The hand-held Tango differs greatly from the wearable computer solutions used by Katz and Loomis, for example, in its form-factor and how it interacts with the user/invironment
--Much of the 3D sound localisation work was done with high-end closed-cup headphones and rich audio signals, where we focussed on non-occluding bonephones and simple tones

-There were concerns about the pure sine wave stimuli used. Spectral perception is highly dependant on the individual, so we opted to use a generic sine wave for this initial study and use varying pitch to convey the elevation instead. We believe the strength of this paper lies in its results showing that a simple, pure sine wave with varying pitch can be used to convey a target's pan/tilt angle to a user with a mobile and compact hand-held device. We leave improving/personalising the tone and improving performance for future work.

-[20] explains the natural association between high/low pitches and high/low targets. We feel it's outside the scope of this work to explain this phenomenon in detail

-Our system design is described in detail in another publication which we can't reference here without risking our anonymity

1.2) Conclusion

We believe that the biggest issues can be remedied by adding more relevant references to position our work better. Most of the ambiguities/confusion can also be cleared with some minor rewording and explanation. We're confident that the resulting paper, if accepted, will be a strong contribution to this conference

2) Reviewer 1

2.1) Preface

-We meant there's a need for an indoor navigation system that can take the VI to their final destination, e.g. a specific aisle in a shop and can be used with cane/dog, since only one hand is occupied; needs of the VI will made more clear

-See 1.1

-Humans are capable of separating perception from action, i.e. they can externalise their frames of reference. See Goodale and Haffenden, and Heffenberg. This is a valid point; addressed in revised paper

2.2) Paper

-Due to space, we focussed on the experiments and their results. A detailed system description is given in another publication; revised system description for clarity

-An HRTF is used to convey ONLY the azimuth, where ITD/IID is sufficient. A pure sine wave is difficult to localise in the tilt dimensions, which is why we use the tone's pitch and this mode's effectiveness is indeed the focus of this work

-The target can be explained more clearly; updated text, included figure to show tilt/pan angles and vertical plane wrt the Tango, target and user

-Used OpenAL's generic KEMAR model; updated text

-We've searched the ICAD database and elsewhere, but couldn't find the work mentioned; reference would be greatly appreciated

3) Reviewer 2

-See 1.1

4) Reviewer 3

4.1) Preface

-See 1.1

-The subjects were given time to look for virtual targets before they were blindfolded, where they became familiar with the 'on-target' tone and what high/low pitches mean. Time was not restricted and stopped when they felt comfortable with the interface. Space concerns kept this from being included; updated text

4.2) Paper

-We manipulate the sine wave's frequency, not the timbre, hence frequency modulated; clarified in text

-Bonephones are non-occluding (important to the VI) and bypass the pennae, making it necessary to convey the tilt using another mode (pitch in this case)

-The frequency range we use (specified in another paper) is roughly within the human speech range and Walker has shown that attenuation in this range is similar to normal hearing
