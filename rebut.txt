1) General:

I'd like to thank everyone for their detailed reviews and constructive criticism. It is very helpful and will hopefully lead to a better paper

The general consensus seems to be that we need to reference more work relevant to our study so that we can position our work better and highlight the novelty of the work presented. Some of the reviewers also gave some suggestions for references.o

I have gone through most of the works suggested (and more) and I have included them in an updated version of the paper. However, I feel that this does not affect the novelty of the work presented: the Tango system we are using  differs greatly from the wearable computer solutions used by Katz and Loomis

2) Reviewer 1:

- I agree that the needs of the VI was never fully specified and elaborated upon. In this context, we meant that there is a need for an indoor navigation system for the VI or something that can take them to the final destination of their journey, e.g. shop's entrance or a specific aisle in that shop and can be used in conjunction with a cane/dog, since only one hand is occupied, or none if a cellphone Tango is used in a breastpocket for example. This can defintely made more clear in text, I agree

- We selected a simple tone to base our initial study on; the objective of this paper was to determine how effective a varying pitch in a sine wave is at conveying a target's elevation and not to evaluate the quality of the tone. We have left the improvement of the tone emitted as future work

!!- Humans are capable of separating their frames of reference for perception and action, at least in the visual realm (see Goodale and Haffenden)

- The reviewer provided many helpful references, many of which have been included in an updated text.

- The HRTF is used here to convey ONLY the pan angle. In this dimension, the ITD and ILD are sufficient. For the elevation, the pitch of the tone is used and is the focus of these experiments and the paper. 

- Diagram is updated

- I agree, the target can be explained more clearly. Will include it in the updated text.

- I have included a new figure to demonstrate the tilt/pan angles and the vertical plane wrt the Tango and user.

- We used generic KEMAR model. I've updated the text to specify this. But again, we do not use OpenAL to convey the tilt, only the pan, where ITD and ILD are sufficient.

!!- Claims varying pitch has been used before for height in ICAD. I cannot find the paper though

- We use the pitch to convey the elevation specifically because of this natural association and included a reference for it [20]. However, another reference is always good.

!!- A sine tone is the most difficult to localise??

3) Reviewer 2:

The reviewer emphasised that we needed to position our work better regarding existing litarature to highlight the novelty of our work and provided some helpful references. Having read these papers, I believe that with some rewording in the literature review section, we can make it clear how our work and approach differs from what has been done previously. E.g. not much work has been done on using non-occluding bonephones with 3D sound cues. 


4) Reviewer 3:

- Signal processing (why did we not do it?)

- Before the experiments were conducted, the subjects were given time to look for virtual targets while they could see the screen, allowing them to become familiar with what the `on-target' tone sounds like and what high/low pitches mean. I did not include this in the original text due to space concerns. 

- Few language errors and text suggestions have been fixed 

- Here the pitch refers to the frequency of the tone/sine wave in Hz. I can edit the paper to make this clearer. 

- We selected bone-conducting headphones because they are discreet and do not occlude ambient sounds

- Bone conduction is low-pass filter. What is an elevated sound source in signal processing theory. 

- On p3 l29 c2 reference [20] explains that human naturally associate high/low pitches with high/low targets. I've added another reference in the updated paper. I feel it is outside the scope of this work to explain this phenomenon in detail.

- More recent references have been included and current ones corrected.
