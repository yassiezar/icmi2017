   However, many works related to the non-visual location of targets of
   interest in a 3d space are not considered. Some works have even evaluated
   the performance for situations where several targets are presented at the
   same time. Here are just a few references that should be considered

   Non-visual identification, localization, and selection of entities of
   interest in a 3D environment. Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces,
   8(3), 243-256.

-  Uses pure 3D audio played over earphones

   maps. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 85, 4-15.

-  Uses pure 3D audio, semi-unique HRTF and earphones

   visual-haptic spatial discrepancy on targeting performance. IEEE
